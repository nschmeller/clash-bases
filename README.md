# Clash Bases

A static, community-editable library of **Clash of Clans base layouts**, built
with **Rust + WebAssembly** (Yew) and hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

Bases live in [`bases.json`](./bases.json) and are committed to the repository.
Visitors can browse, search and filter the catalogue, then click **Open in
Clash** to load a layout straight into the game via the official
`link.clashofclans.com` URL scheme.

## How it works

- The site is a single-page Rust/WASM app compiled to a static bundle by
  [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev).
- At load time it `fetch`-es `bases.json` and renders a card for each entry.
- Each card has a deep link to the COC mobile app
  (`https://link.clashofclans.com/?action=OpenLayout&id=...`). On a phone with
  the game installed, tapping it opens the layout directly. On desktop it
  shows a web preview with a QR code.
- There is no backend, no database and no analytics. The repo *is* the
  database.

## Where to find bases

If you don't have your own layout to share, these are well-known
community catalogues. Open the base you like, copy the in-game share
link, and submit it via PR (with attribution to the original builder):

- [cocbases.com](https://cocbases.com/town-hall-16/)
- [clashofclans-layouts.com](https://clashofclans-layouts.com/plans/th_16/war/)
- [basemelon.com](https://basemelon.com/coc-bases-th16/war)
- [clashbaselink.com](https://clashbaselink.com/th16-base-layout/)
- [blueprintcoc.com](https://blueprintcoc.com/blogs/town-hall-16)
- [Reddit r/ClashOfClansBases](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClansBases/)

Please respect each site's terms of use. Do not bulk-import bases
without permission — share the ones you've personally tested and credit
the original builder.

## Adding a base

1. In-game, open the layout you want to share, tap **Share**, choose **Copy
   link**.
2. Add an entry to [`bases.json`](./bases.json):

   ```json
   {
     "id": "th16-war-mybase",
     "name": "My Base Name",
     "town_hall": 16,
     "type": "War",
     "link": "https://link.clashofclans.com/en?action=OpenLayout&id=TH16%3AWB%3A...",
     "description": "Short notes about the base.",
     "builder": "YourName",
     "tags": ["anti-3-star", "anti-rootrider"],
     "added": "2026-04-26"
   }
   ```

3. Open a pull request. Once merged to `main`, the GitHub Actions workflow
   rebuilds the site and publishes it to Pages.

> **Tip:** there's an interactive helper that does step 2 for you:
>
> ```bash
> ./scripts/add-base.sh
> ```
>
> It picks up the layout link from your clipboard if one is there, prompts
> for the remaining fields, and validates the result before writing.

## Local development

Prerequisites: Rust 1.85+ (edition 2024) and the `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
target.

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install --locked trunk
trunk serve --open
```

`trunk serve` watches for changes to `src/`, `index.html`, `styles.css` and
`bases.json`, and live-reloads the browser.

To produce a production bundle:

```bash
trunk build --release --public-url /clash-bases/
```

The output is written to `dist/`.

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` trigger
[`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml), which:

1. Installs the stable Rust toolchain plus `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
2. Installs Trunk and `wasm-bindgen-cli`.
3. Runs `trunk build --release --public-url "/<repo-name>/"`.
4. Uploads `dist/` as a Pages artifact and deploys it.

To enable this for your fork:

1. Settings → **Pages** → set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
2. Push to `main`.
